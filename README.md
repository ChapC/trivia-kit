## TriviaKit
A collection of web apps I made to host a trivia/gameshow night for my friends!

#### Features:
- 📺 Display text/audio/video questions on a TV via a web browser
- 👩‍🏫 Control the TV display on your mobile/tablet device using the host interface
- 🔴 Mix in gameshow-style buzzer questions. Players simply connect to your wifi and scan a QR code to play on their phones

#### Usage:
